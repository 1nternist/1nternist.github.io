=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_auto_configure> [S<I<build system options>>] [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_auto_configure> is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
configure a package prior to building. It does so by running the
appropriate command for the build system it detects the package uses.
For example, it looks for and runs a F<./configure> script, F<Makefile.PL>,
F<Build.PL>, or F<cmake>. A standard set of parameters is determined and passed
to the program that is run. Some build systems, such as make, do not
need a configure step; for these B<dh_auto_configure> will exit without
doing anything.

This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work,
you're encouraged to skip using B<dh_auto_configure> at all, and just run
F<./configure> or its equivalent manually.

=head1 OPTIONS

See L<debhelper(7)/B<BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS>> for a list of common build
system selection and control options.

=over 4

=item B<--> I<params>

Pass I<params> to the program that is run, after the parameters that
B<dh_auto_configure> usually passes. For example:

  dh_auto_configure -- --with-foo --enable-bar
