=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_auto_build> [S<I<build system options>>] [S<I<debhelper options>>] [S<B<--> I<params>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_auto_build> is a debhelper program that tries to automatically build a
package. It does so by running the appropriate command for the build system
it detects the package uses. For example, if a F<Makefile> is found, this is
done by running B<make> (or B<MAKE>, if the environment variable is set). If
there's a F<setup.py>, or F<Build.PL>, it is run to build the package.

This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work,
you're encouraged to skip using B<dh_auto_build> at all, and just run the
build process manually.

=head1 OPTIONS

See L<debhelper(7)/B<BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS>> for a list of common build
system selection and control options.

=item B<--> I<params>
