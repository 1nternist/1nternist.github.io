=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_strip> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [B<-X>I<item>] [B<--dbg-package=>I<package>] [B<--keep-debug>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_strip> is a debhelper program that is responsible for stripping
executables, shared libraries, and static libraries that are not used for
debugging.

This program examines your package build directories and works out what
to strip on its own. It uses L<file(1)> and file permissions and filenames
to figure out what files are shared libraries (F<*.so>), executable binaries,
and static (F<lib*.a>) and debugging libraries (F<lib*_g.a>, F<debug/*.so>), and
strips each as much as is possible. (Which is not at all for debugging
libraries.) In general it seems to make very good guesses, and will do the
right thing in almost all cases.

Since it is very hard to automatically guess if a file is a
module, and hard to determine how to strip a module, B<dh_strip> does not
currently deal with stripping binary modules such as F<.o> files.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-X>I<item>, B<--exclude=>I<item>

Exclude files that contain I<item> anywhere in their filename from being
stripped. You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of
things to exclude.

=item B<--dbg-package=>I<package>

Causes B<dh_strip> to save debug symbols stripped from the packages it acts on
as independent files in the package build directory of the specified debugging
package.

For example, if your packages are libfoo and foo and you want to include a
I<foo-dbg> package with debugging symbols, use B<dh_strip --dbg-package=>I<foo-dbg>.

Note that this option behaves significantly different in debhelper
compatibility levels 4 and below. Instead of specifying the name of a debug
package to put symbols in, it specifies a package (or packages) which
should have separated debug symbols, and the separated symbols are placed
in packages with B<-dbg> added to their name.

=item B<-k>, B<--keep-debug>

Debug symbols will be retained, but split into an independent
file in F<usr/lib/debug/> in the package build directory. B<--dbg-package>
is easier to use than this option, but this option is more flexible.

=back

=head1 NOTES

If the B<DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS> environment variable contains B<nostrip>, nothing
will be stripped, in accordance with Debian policy (section 10.1
"Binaries").
