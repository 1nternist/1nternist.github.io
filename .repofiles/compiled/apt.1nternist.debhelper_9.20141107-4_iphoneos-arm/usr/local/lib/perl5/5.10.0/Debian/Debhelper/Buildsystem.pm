# Return 0 if the source is not buildable, or a positive integer
# otherwise.
#
# Generally, it is enough to look for invariant unique build system
# files shipped with clean source to determine if the source might
# be buildable or not. However, if the build system is derived from
# another other auto-buildable build system, this method
# may also check if the source has already been built with this build
# system partitially by looking for temporary files or other common
# results the build system produces during the build process. The
# latter checks must be unique to the current build system and must
# be very unlikely to be true for either its parent or other build
# systems. If it is determined that the source has already built
# partitially with this build system, the value returned must be
# greater than the one of the SUPER call.
