=head1 NAME

Linux::APT - Interface with APT for Debian distributions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl interface to C<apt-get> and C<apt-cache>.
If Debian's C<aptpkg> modules were on CPAN, this module (probably) wouldn't be necessary.
This is just a wrapper around the C<apt> tools along with some regular expression magic
to capture interesting pieces of information/warnings/errors in the process.
It doesn't do I<everything> that is possible, but it should fill the most typical needs.
Features will be added on request or my own need.
Please file a wishlist bug report on the CPAN bug tracker with your feature requests.

All (or almost all?) features require root privileges.
If you can use C<sudo> to provide this functionality, see C<new> to see how to do this.

It's not ready for production use, but you're welcome to give it a try.
I<Please> file bug reports if you come across any problems/bugs/etc.
Patches are always welcomed, of course.

=head1 EXAMPLE

  my $apt = Linux::APT->new;
  my $update = $apt->update;
  my $toupgrade = $apt->toupgrade;
  my $upgraded = $apt->install(keys(%{$toupgrade->{packages}}));

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $apt = Linux::APT->new;

  # only if you _really_ want to see what's going on...
  my $apt = Linux::APT->new(debug => 1);

  # if you want to use an alternate apt-get/apt-cache binary
  my $apt = Linux::APT->new(
    aptget => '/some/path/to/apt-get',
    aptcache => '/some/path/to/apt-cache',
  );

  # if you have special needs (like sudo, etc)
  my $apt = Linux::APT->new(
    aptget => '/usr/bin/sudo /some/path/to/apt-get -s', # sudo and no-act
    aptcache => '/usr/bin/sudo /some/path/to/apt-cache', # sudo
  );

Creates an instance of Linux::APT, just like you would expect.

If you have special needs for only one function (install maybe?), make a separate instance
with your special needs (flags, sudo, etc) and use that instance for your special need.

If your special need can't be accommodated via the C<aptget> option above, let me know and
I'll attempt to implement whatever it is that you need within the module or make your special
need a bit more "accessible" to you.
File a bug report on the CPAN bug tracker.
Patches welcome, of course.

Arguments available:

=over

=item debug

Set to C<1> to enable, defaults to C<0>.

=item aptget

Specify the C<apt-get> binary to use along with any special flags or command line tricks (sudo, chroot, fakeroot, etc).
Defaults to C<`which apt-get`>.

=item aptcache

Specify the C<apt-cache> binary to use along with any special flags or command line tricks (sudo, chroot, fakeroot, etc).
Defaults to C<`which apt-cache`>.

Requires one or more search arguments in regex format.  Optional options as first
argument in hashref format.

Return a hashref of packages that match the regex search.

=head2 install

  # install or upgrade the specified packages (and all deps)
  my $install = $apt->install('nautilus', 'libcups2', 'rhythmbox');

  # just a dry run
  my $install = $apt->install('-test', 'nautilus', 'libcups2', 'rhythmbox');

  my $toupgrade = $apt->toupgrade;
  my $install = $apt->install(grep(m/pulseaudio/i, keys(%{$toupgrade->{packages}})));

Install a list of packages.
If the packages are already installed, they will be upgraded if an upgrade is available.

Pass in these optional options:

=over

=item -force

If you wish to force an update (eg: C<WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!>),
pass C<-force> as one of your arguments (same effect as C<apt-get --force-yes install $packages>).

=item -test

If you just want to know what packages would be installed/upgraded/removed, pass C<-test>
as one of your arguments.
No actions will actually take place, only the actions that would have been performed will be captured.
This is useful when you want to ensure some bad thing doesn't happen on accident (like removing
C<apache2-mpm-worker> when you install C<php5>) or to allow you to present the proposed changes to the
user via a user interface (GUI, webapp, etc).

=back

Returns hashref of packages, errors, and warnings:

=over

=item warning

Warnings, if any.

=item error

Errors, if any.

=item packages

Contains a hashref of installed/upgraded packages.
Keys are package names.
Each item is a hashref containing these items:

=over

=item current

Currently installed version (after install/upgrade attempt).
This version is found via an experimental technique and might fail (though it has yet to fail for me).
Let me know if you find a bug or have a problem with this value.

=item new

Version to be installed.
If C<new == current>, the action seems to have succeeded.

=item old

Version that was installed before the upgrade was performed.
If C<old == current>, the action seems to have failed.
