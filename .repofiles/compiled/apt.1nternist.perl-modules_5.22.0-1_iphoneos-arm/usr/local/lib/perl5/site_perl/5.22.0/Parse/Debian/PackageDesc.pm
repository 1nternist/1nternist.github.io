=head1 NAME

Parse::Debian::PackageDesc - Parses Debian changes and source package files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Parse::Debian::PackageDesc;
 my $changes = Parse::Debian::PackageDesc->new('/path/foo.changes');
 my $source  = Parse::Debian::PackageDesc->new('/path/foo.dsc');
 my $pkg     = Parse::Debian::PackageDesc->new($changes_or_dsc,
                                               gpg_homedir => '/dir/gnupg');
 print $pkg->name, "\n";
 print $pkg->version, "\n";
 print $pkg->debian_revision, "\n";
 print $pkg->distribution, "\n";
 print join(", ", $pkg->binary_packages), "\n";
 print $pkg->changes, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Parse::Debian::PackageDesc> parses a Debian C<.changes> file (or a C<.dsc>
file) and allows you to retrieve its information easily. It can even check for
GPG signatures, assuming you have GNUPG installed and an appropriate
configuration.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new($path)>

=item C<new($path, %user_opts)>

Creates a new object representing the C<.changes> or C<.dsc> file in C<$path>.
The only valid option for C<%user_opts> is C<gpg_homedir>, which points to the
GNUPG home directory with the appropriate options and keyrings for GPG
signature validation.

=back

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item C<path>

Returns the changes/dsc file path (the one given in the constructor).

=item C<date>

Returns the latest package revision date.

=item C<name>

=item C<source>

Returns the name of the source package.

=item C<version>

Returns the full package version.

=item C<upstream_version>

Returns the upstream version of the package. For native packages, the full
version is returned.

=item C<debian_revision>

Returns just the Debian revision of the package. So, if the full version is
C<3.15-5>, it returns just C<5>. For native packages, C<""> is returned.

=item C<distribution>

Returns the distribution the package is for.

=item C<urgency>

Returns the urgency for the package.

=item C<maintainer>

Returns the package maintainer.

=item C<changed_by>

Returns who made the upload.

=item C<binary_packages>

Returns a list of binary package names in the changes/dsc file.

=item C<changes>

Returns the latest package revision changelog entry.

=item C<files>

Returns the list of files referenced by the changes/dsc file.

=item C<binary_package_files>

Returns the list of binary package files referenced by the changes/dsc file.

=item C<signature_id>

Returns the key id for the signature of the changes/dsc file, or C<undef> if
there was no signature or there was some error with C<gpg>.

=item C<correct_signature>

Returns whether the the changes/dsc file has a correct signature.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

This module requires no configuration file or environment variables. However,
you may want to setup a special GNUPG directory with a defined keyring to
validate the GNUPG signatures.
