NAME
    Test::Script - Basic cross-platform tests for scripts

DESCRIPTION
    The intent of this module is to provide a series of basic tests for 80%
    of the testing you will need to do for scripts in the script (or bin as
    is also commonly used) paths of your Perl distribution.

    Further, it aims to provide this functionality with perfect
    platform-compatibility, and in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible.

    That is, if the program works on a platform, then Test::Script should
    always work on that platform as well. Anything less than 100% is
    considered unacceptable.

    In doing so, it is hoped that Test::Script can become a module that you
    can safely make a dependency of all your modules, without risking that
    your module won't on some platform because of the dependency.

    Where a clash exists between wanting more functionality and maintaining
    platform safety, this module will err on the side of platform safety.

FUNCTIONS
  script_compiles
        script_compiles( 'script/foo.pl', 'Main script compiles' );

    The "script_compiles" test calls the script with "perl -c script.pl",
    and checks that it returns without error.

    The path it should be passed is a relative unix-format script name. This
    will be localised when running "perl -c" and if the test fails the local
    name used will be shown in the diagnostic output.

    Note also that the test will be run with the same perl interpreter that
    is running the test script (and not with the default system perl). This
    will also be shown in the diagnostic output on failure.

  script_runs
        script_runs( 'script/foo.pl', 'Main script runs' );

    The "script_runs" test executes the script with "perl script.pl" and
    checks that it returns success.

    The path it should be passed is a relative unix-format script name. This
    will be localised when running "perl -c" and if the test fails the local
    name used will be shown in the diagnostic output.

    The test will be run with the same perl interpreter that is running the
    test script (and not with the default system perl). This will also be
    shown in the diagnostic output on failure.
