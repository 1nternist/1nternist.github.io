Math::BigRat - arbitrarily big rational numbers

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- - ..--- - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

This package is a subclass of Math::BigFloat. You need the rewritten version
of Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat for it to work.

To test, unzip & untar package, then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

See INSTALL for detailed help on installing these modules.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
