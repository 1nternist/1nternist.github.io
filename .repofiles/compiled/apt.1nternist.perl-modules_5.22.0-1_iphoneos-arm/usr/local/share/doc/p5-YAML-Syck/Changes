[Changes for 1.09 (JSON::Syck 0.32) - 2010-05-29]

* Exactly equivalent to 1.08_01, aside from bumping the version
  numbers

[Changes for 1.08_01 (JSON::Syck 0.31_01) - 2010-05-23]

* Reset the hash iterator after dumping hashes. Solves RT #54167 and
  the duplicate RT #34166.

* RT #39572: Only print 0.60 compatibility warning if 0.60 or earlier
  is installed.

[Changes for 1.08 (JSON::Syck 0.31) - 2010-05-23]

Like the 1.07_01 test release aside from small documentation
improvements.

* Include a WARNING section in the YAML::Syck pod that mentions that
  the module hasn't been actively maintained since 2007, and that
  perhaps prospective users might want to turn elsewhere.

[Changes for 1.07_01 (JSON::Syck 0.30) - 2010-05-20]

About:

First release by new maintainer (AVAR). The source repository is now
hosted in Git at http://github.com/avar/YAML-Syck

YAML::Syck is still pretty much abandonware, all its bugs likely to
get fixed any time soon.

Code fixes:

* Strings starting with : are now always quoted. Ruby will interpret
  anything starting with a colon as a symbol. Before this fix strings
  exported from YAML::Syck would be interpreted as Ruby symbols when
  read by Ruby's syck.

Release engineering fixes:

* Upgrade from Module::Install 0.68 to 0.97

* Bump included Test::More dependency

* Remove included inc/attributes.pm dependency. Nothing in our
  dependencies used this anymore.

* Add homepage, bugtracker, and repository metadata to META.yml

* Bump perl dependency from 5.00307 to 5.006. 5.005 is all
  Module::Install supported, and YAML::Syck depends on Scalar::Util
  which only goes as low as 5.006.

[Changes for 1.07 (JSON::Syck 0.30) - 2009-04-25]

* Added the missing Loadfile function to JSON::Syck.
  Reported by: Dan McCormick

[Changes for 1.05 (JSON::Syck 0.29) - 2008-06-09]

* Loading a YAML stream containing Regexp nodes under -d:DProf should
  not fail with "panic: Devel::DProf inconsistent subroutine return".
  Reported by: Richard Jelinek

[Changes for 1.04 (JSON::Syck 0.29) - 2008-02-17]

* The 'Name "YAML::Syck::ImplicitBinary" used only once: possible typo'
  warnings no longer triggers in Perl 5.10 when running with perl -w.
  Reported by: Jesse Vincent

[Changes for 1.03 (JSON::Syck 0.29) - 2008-02-16]

* JSON::Syck: When $JSON::Syck::SingleQuote is false, implicit booleans
  such as "yes" and "no" should be dumped with double quotes, instead of
  single quotes (which breaks RFC 4627).
  Reported by: cho45

[Changes for 1.02 (JSON::Syck 0.28) - 2008-02-16]

* JSON::Syck: Colons in single-quoted strings are no longer loaded
  with an extra space after it.
  Reported by: Agent Zhang

[Changes for 1.01 (JSON::Syck 0.27) - 2008-01-19]

  Contributed by: Andreas Koenig

  Contributed by: Andreas Koenig

  to further reduce our memory footprint.

[Changes for 1.00 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-12-10]

* When $YAML::Syck::SingleQuote is set to true, Dump() now emits newlines
  in strings correctly.  (Previously it would emit extra newlines.)

[Changes for 0.99 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-10-23]

* TODOify tests as appropriate for Perl 5.005 and Perl 5.6.x.

[Changes for 0.98 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-10-13]

* Restore support for Perl 5.005 and earlier.

[Changes for 0.97 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-09-03]

* When loading !!perl/code with $YAML::Syck::LoadCode set to false,
  YAML::Syck now returns a coderef that does nothing (i.e. sub {}),
  in accordance with YAML.pm's treatment, instead of returning the
  actual code of the sub as a string.
  Contributed by: Florian Ragwitz

[Changes for 0.96 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-08-08]

* The always-quote rule now applies to all implicit booleans
  and null values, i.e. strings that match the following regex:

    /y|Y
    |n|N
    |yes|Yes|YES
    |no|No|NO
    |true|True|TRUE
    |false|False|FALSE
    |on|On|ON
    |off|Off|OFF
    |null|Null|NULL
    |~
    /x

* Bare literals "Y", "N", "y" and "n" are now recognized as
  booleans when loading with implicit typing turned on.

* Mixed case strings that does not represent implicit boolean
  values, such as "yES" and "nO", are no longer always-quoted.
  Contributed by: Malcolm Studd

[Changes for 0.95 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-08-04]

* "Yes" and "no" (including all upper/lower case forms) are now
  always dumped in quoted form to avoid ambiguities when loaded
  by loaders with ImplicitTyping set to true.
  Reported by: Malcolm Studd

* lib/YAML/Syck.pod is merged back into lib/YAML/Syck.pm.
  (No functional changes.)

[Changes for 0.94 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-07-10]

* Repair broken PAUSE upload, again. (Sigh.)

[Changes for 0.93 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-07-10]

* Repair broken PAUSE upload.

[Changes for 0.92 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-07-10]

* Allow for LoadFile(*FH) and DumpFile(*FH), in addition to
  ($fh) and (\*FH).  Also, new tests for LoadFile and DumpFile.
  Contributed by: Adriano Ferreira

[Changes for 0.91 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-06-23]

* Corrected loading Regexps with all combinations of quantifiers.
  Contributed by: Ingy döt Net

[Changes for 0.90 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-06-22]

* Regexes are now dump/loaded correctly with modifiers, with a new
  representation: "--- !!perl/regexp:main (?i-xsm:1)", instead of the
  old mapping with a REGEXP key.  The old form still loads correctly;
  the new form corresponds to YAML.pm 0.63 and later.
  Requested by: Ingy döt Net

* Loading regexes with modifiers no longer involves an eval"" call.

[Changes for 0.88 (JSON::Syck 0.26) - 2007-06-17]

* New dependency: Scalar::Util, for LoadFile and DumpFile functions.
  You can safely do without that module if you do not make use of the
  two functions.

* LoadFile and DumpFile now accept glob values, and reject unopened
  handles properly instead of silently ignores it.
  Contributed by: Adriano Ferreira

[Changes for 0.87 (JSON::Syck 0.25) - 2007-06-17]

* New LoadFile and DumpFile functions for JSON::Syck.

  Requested by: Adriano Ferreira

[Changes for 0.86 (JSON::Syck 0.24) - 2007-06-16]

* Support for dumping and loading regexps created by qr//, including
  blessed once.  Note that loading Regexp values dumped by YAML.pm
  currently discards modifiers.

[Changes for 0.85 (JSON::Syck 0.24) - 2007-04-20]

* Strings containing both single quotes and newlines were incorrectly 
  quoted with backslash-escaped single quotes.  This is a regression
  introduced in YAML::Syck 0.84.
  Reported by: Agent Zhang

[Changes for 0.84 (JSON::Syck 0.23) - 2007-04-02]

* New $YAML::Syck::SingleQuote flag: When it is set to true, Dump will
  always emit quotes instead of bare strings.
  Requested by: Ingo Bax

* When $JSON::Syck::SingleQuote is set to true, special characters such as
  \r\n are still escaped as usual, because JavaScript allows the same form
  of escaping in strings with either quotes.
  Reported by: Dobrica Pavlinusic

[Changes for 0.83 (JSON::Syck 0.22) - 2007-02-05]

* Under JSON::Syck, as well as YAML::Syck when $ImplicitTyping is set to
  true, integer numbers larger than an unsigned integer (>=4294967296 on
  32-bit platforms) was erroneously loaded as 0.
  Reported by: Markus Wörle

  when dumping a circular structure.

[Changes for 0.80 (JSON::Syck 0.20) - 2007-01-26]

* LICENSING CHANGE: This compilation and all individual files in it
  (except for the bundled libsyck code) are now under the permissive
  "MIT" license.  See the COPYRIGHT section in README for the new terms.

* Load("!! []") no longer segfaults due to empty tag names.

* Load("!!Foo []") now blesses into "Foo", not "Foo::\0".

  YAML 1.1 implementations.

[Changes for 0.46_02 (JSON::Syck 0.13) - 2006-06-29]

  blessed references work: See http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PerlTagScheme
  for the new specification.
