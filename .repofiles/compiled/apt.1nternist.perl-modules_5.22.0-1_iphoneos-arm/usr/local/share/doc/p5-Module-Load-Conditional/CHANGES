Changes for 0.30    Mon Jan 19 16:25:55 CET 2009

  VMS in UNIX compatible mode.

  return value of check_install()

Changes for 0.26    Fri Feb 29 16:01:15 CET 2008
=================================================
* Address #32817: $INC{'Module/Load/Conditional.pm'}
  isn't canonicalized under Win32. This exposed an
  issue in the test suite under ActivePerl for Win32,
  but not the code itself.
  Users of 0.24 do not need to upgrade.

Changes for 0.24    Wed Jan  2 16:53:19 CET 2008
=================================================
* Readdress #29348 to make sure version comparisons

  nicely with taint mode enabled.

* Update directory depth of test files to be less
  than 8 under perl core for old VAX and VMS
  compatibility. Users who have installed 0.18 do

  handle alphas? by always using qv() to compare
  version strings.

Changes for 0.17_01 Sun Sep  9 11:55:54 CEST 2007
=================================================
* Most VMS specifics can now be removed from the
  test suite, as we now depend on a newer version
  of Module::Load, which will hide this all away.

Changes for 0.16    Thu Jan 25 22:24:36 CET 2007
=================================================
* Address #23995: Version parsing code has been
  improved and now partly relies on version.pm.

  parse under certain conditions.

  this behaviour.

  where the directory seperator is not the same
  as the %INC path seperator
