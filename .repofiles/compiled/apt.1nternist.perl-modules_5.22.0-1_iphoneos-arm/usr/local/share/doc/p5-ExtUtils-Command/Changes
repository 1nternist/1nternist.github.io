      - Updated our internal version of Test::More to catch a few warnings. 
      - ExtUtils::Command::test_f() test was broken.
  
  The exit() override for test_f() was always returning 1 because it was
  returning a list in scalar context!

  r2436@windhund:  schwern | 2005-07-23 00:49:46 -0700
      * ExtUtils::Command, ExtUtils::Install, ExtUtils::Manifest, 
        ExtUtils::Mkbootstrap, ExtUtils::Mksymlists and ExtUtils::Packlist 
        are all now considered to be separate distributions.  To avoid a  
        circular dependency, MakeMaker distributes its own versions but CPAN  
        should not index them and they will not overwrite a newer, installed  
        version. 
  
  We accomplish this by moving the auxillaries into inc/ and then culling
  them out of $self->{PM} with an override.  This is not ideal as it requires
  too much poking at the internals.  The final approach will probably be a
  three stage with auxillaries in extra_libs/ moved to inc/ before
  WriteMakefile is run.
  
  init_dirscan() has been split into init_MANPODS, init_MAN1PODS, init_MAN3PODS
  and init_PM for better encapsulation and easier overriding.
  
  init_MAN*PODS now share the same POD scanning code.
  
  Added an undocumented PMLIBPARENTDIRS flag to tell MakeMaker which
  directories should be treated as parent directories when determining
  what modules are below them.

  Doc improvements.
  
  Mention Shell::Command
  
  Put function examples in the function description rather than on the =item
  line to make the =items cleaner and easier to read.
  
  Remove BUGS section.  This module is so small it doesn't need
  autoloaded.
  
  Remove pointers to other MakeMaker modules, they really have nothing to do
  with this.

     - Added ExtUtils::Command::dos2unix()
     - Fixed 'make dist' problem on OS/2.  The odd TO_UNIX macro using a
       zip/unzip trick was making the distribution files read-only.

     * ExtUtils::Command::chmod was not interpreting file permissions as
       octal strings.  Also, docs & tests slightly wrong (thanks Stas Bekman).
 
 Tests could load the installed version of ExtUtils::Command.
