1.22    2010-02-12  DCANTRELL  Previous release was in error.  Instead, fix
                                 the problem, circular structures now
                                 compare equal, no matter what the starting
                                 point (see RT 52836)

1.2102  2010-02-01  DCANTRELL  Add doco about structural vs data equivalence
                                 (see RT 52836)

1.2101  2009-05-05  DCANTRELL  Add full licence text; -I fix in taint tests
                                 to cope with paths with a space in 'em
                                 (thanks to MATISSE, see RT 45676)

1.21    2008-08-21  DCANTRELL  Extra tests added in 1.20 now skip with
                                 really old JSON

1.20    2008-08-21  DCANTRELL  Added test for bug reported by Saritha
                                 Nalagandla (no bug found, but you can never
                                 have too many tests!)
                               Fixed bug in PERL5LIB splitting in taint test
                                 (thanks to ADAMK, see RT 38319)

1.19    2008-05-12  DCANTRELL  Can now compare structures with repeats in 'em
                                 like [\$z, \$z] (bug reported by Todd Hepler)
                               Minor code tidying

1.18    2008-01-15  DCANTRELL  Got rid of prototypes;
                               File::Find::Rule now only loads when needed;
                               Plugins can be ignored with a null import() list;
                               Explicitly documented the auto-export;
                               Got rid of diagnostics pragma

                               Fixed problem with taint testing when PERL5LIB
                                 is set (thanks to Andreas Koenig for finding
                                 the bug)
                               Minor doco fiddling

0.13    2004-11-09  DCANTRELL  Oops, left in some debugging output
0.12    2004-11-09  DCANTRELL  Fixed recursion detection bug - wasn't decrementing
                               counter properly!  (thanks to Jenda for the bug
                               report)
0.11    2004-06-02  DCANTRELL  Now taint-safe - in taint mode there's no plugins
                               (thanks Gabor Szabo for reporting the bug)
0.10    2004-03-13  DCANTRELL  Replaced recursion detection with Rusty Conover's

                               once.  S::P plugin renamed so it would work with
                               this bugfix.  Clean-up of code.  Fix minor doc-bug
                               in lib/Data/Compare/Plugins.pod.
