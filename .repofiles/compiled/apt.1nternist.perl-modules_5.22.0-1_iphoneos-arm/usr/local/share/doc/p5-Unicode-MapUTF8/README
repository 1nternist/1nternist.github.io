Unicode::MapUTF8 - Conversions to and from arbitrary character sets and UTF8

Provides an adapter layer between core routines for converting
to and from UTF8 and other encodings. In essence, a way to give 
multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface so 
you don't have to know the underlaying implementations to do 
simple UTF8 to-from other character set string conversions. 
As such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8,
Unicode::Map and Jcode modules in a standardized and simple 
API.

Mainly intended for use with Perl 5.6 and 5.0 since starting
with Perl 5.8 the Encode modules are the preferred way of
handling character set encodings.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Alternatively, if you have Module::Build installed,

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

See 'perldoc Unicode::MapUTF8' for the documentation.
