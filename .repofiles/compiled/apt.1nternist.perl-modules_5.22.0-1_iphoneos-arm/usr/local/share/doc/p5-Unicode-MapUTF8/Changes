1.11 2005.10.10   Documentation changes. Addition of Build.PL support.
                  Added various build tests, LICENSE, Artistic_License.txt,
                  GPL_License.txt. Split documentation into seperate
                  .pod file. Added Japanese translation of POD.

1.10 2005.05.22 - Fixed bug in conversion of ISO-2022-JP to UTF-8.
                  Problem and fix found by Masahiro HONMA
                  <masahiro.honma@tsutaya.co.jp>.

                  Similar bugs in conversions of shift_jis and euc-jp
                  to UTF-8 corrected as well.

1.09 2001.08.22 - Fixed multiple typo occurances of 'uft'
                  where 'utf' was meant in code. Problem affected
                  utf16 and utf7 encodings. Problem found
                  by devon smith <devon@taller.PSCL.cwru.edu>

1.08 2000.11.06 Added 'utf8_charset_alias' function to allow for runtime
                setting of character set aliases. Added several alternate
                names for 'sjis' (shiftjis, shift-jis, shift_jis, s-jis,
                and s_jis). 

                Corrected 'croak' messages for 'from_utf8' functions to
                appropriate function name.

                Corrected fatal problem in jcode-unicode internals. Problem 
                and fix found by Brian Wisti <wbrian2@uswest.net>.

1.07 2000.11.01 Added 'croak' to use Carp declaration to fix error
                messages. Problem and fix found by <wbrian2@uswest.net>.

1.06 2000.10.30 Fix to handle change in stringification of overloaded
                objects between Perl 5.005 and 5.6.  
                Problem noticed by Brian Wisti <wbrian2@uswest.net>.

1.05 2000.10.23 Error in conversions from UTF8 to multibyte encodings corrected

1.04 2000.10.23 Additional diagnostic error messages added for
                internal errors

1.03 2000.10.22 Bug fix for load time Unicode::Map encoding
                detection

1.02 2000.10.22 Bug fix to 'from_utf8' method and load time
                detection of Unicode::Map8 supported character
                set encodings

1.01 2000.10.02 Initial public release

Provides an adapter layer between core routines for converting
to and from UTF8 and other encodings. In essence, a way to give 
multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface so 
you don't have to know the underlaying implementations to do 
simple UTF8 to-from other character set string conversions. 
As such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8,
Unicode::Map and Jcode modules in a standardized and simple 
API.
