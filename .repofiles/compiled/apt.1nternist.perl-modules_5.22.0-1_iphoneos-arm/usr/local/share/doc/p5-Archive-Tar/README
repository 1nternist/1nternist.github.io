This is the README file for Archive::Tar, the Perl module for creation
and in-memory manipulation of tar files.

* Installation

Archive::Tar uses the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test (optional but recommended)
make install

This module uses no C-coded parts in itself, but it will try to use
the IO::Zlib module to read and write gzipped tarfiles.
Archive::Tar will still work without IO::Zlib, it will just complain
when you try to use a compressed archive or write one, since it
obviously can't.
