NAME
    File::Listing - parse directory listing

SYNOPSIS
     use File::Listing qw(parse_dir);
     $ENV{LANG} = "C";  # dates in non-English locales not supported
     for (parse_dir(`ls -l`)) {
         ($name, $type, $size, $mtime, $mode) = @$_;
         next if $type ne 'f'; # plain file
         #...
     }

     # directory listing can also be read from a file
     open(LISTING, "zcat ls-lR.gz|");
     $dir = parse_dir(\*LISTING, '+0000');

DESCRIPTION
    This module exports a single function called parse_dir(), which can be
    used to parse directory listings.

    The first parameter to parse_dir() is the directory listing to parse. It
    can be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob
    representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.

    The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in
    the listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is
    assumed.

    The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently
    supported formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value
    is 'unix'. Ideally, the listing type should be determined automatically.

    The fourth parameter specifies how unparseable lines should be treated.
    Values can be 'ignore', 'warn' or a code reference. Warn means that the
    perl warn() function will be called. If a code reference is passed, then
    this routine will be called and the return value from it will be
    incorporated in the listing. The default is 'ignore'.

    Only the first parameter is mandatory.

    The return value from parse_dir() is a list of directory entries. In a
    scalar context the return value is a reference to the list. The
    directory entries are represented by an array consisting of [ $filename,
    $filetype, $filesize, $filetime, $filemode ]. The $filetype value is one
    of the letters 'f', 'd', 'l' or '?'. The $filetime value is the seconds
    since Jan 1, 1970. The $filemode is a bitmask like the mode returned by
    stat().
