DESCRIPTION
-----------
 
This distribution consists of a number of Source Filters.

For more details see the pod documentation embedded in the .pm files.

If you intend using the Filter::Call functionality, I would strongly
recommend that you check out Damian Conway's excellent Filter::Simple
module. Damian's module provides a much cleaner interface than
Filter::Util::Call. Although it doesn't allow the fine control that
Filter::Util::Call does, it should be adequate for the majority of
applications. It's available at

   http://search.cpan.org/dist/Filter-Simple/

PREREQUISITES
-------------
 
Before you can build the Source Filters you need to have the following
installed on your system:

    * Perl 5.005 or better. 5.6.0 or better is recommended for Win32.

If your Perl is less than version 5.004_55, the "order" test harness
will be skipped.


BUILDING THE MODULES
--------------------
 
Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the modules
should be relatively straightforward.

The modules can now be built using this sequence of commands:
 
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
 
The filters have been successfully built and tested on the following
systems (at least):

	linux (gcc or clang)
	cygwin 1.7
	mingw strawberry 5.14
	SunOS 4.1.3 (Sun C compiler & gcc 2.7.2.3)
	Solaris 2.3 (Sun C Compiler)
	irix 5.3	
	irix 6.x	
	Windows NT 4.0 (Visual C++ 5.0 and Borland C++ 5.02)

On Windows NT tr and cpp should be really the gnu tools in the path
for the testsuite to pass successfully.

INSTALLATION
------------
 
    make install
