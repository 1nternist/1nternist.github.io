Revision history for Perl extension lib

0.62  Sun Mar 15 18:01 2009
  - Add a fake package for PAUSE to index.

0.61  Sat Oct 25 12:05 2008
  - The Makefile.PL breakage in 0.59_01 and 0.60 wasn't detected
    for a month, but it was still there!
  - Fix META_ADD for recent MakeMakers.

0.60  Thu Oct 23 23:00 2008
  - No breakage in a month, release stable lib.

0.59_01  Sun Sep 28 11:32 2008
  - Add special case to Makefile.PL for ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.46 and up.
  * To P5P: This is purely a change to the CPAN distribution. The module code is
    unchanged from 0.59, a patch to the perl core is not necessary.

0.59  Sun Jun 29 10:38 2008
  - Merge changes from blead, documentation fixes.

0.58  Thu Jun 12 10:00 2008
  - Repaired distribution, now indexable by PAUSE.

0.57  Mon May 26 16:22 2008
  - First release to CPAN. Previously available in core perl.
  - Released to CPAN in order to backport a fix for
    "use lib 'foo.par'" which should not warn about
    foo.par being a file. (Any files with other extensions
    still trigger warnings as appropriate.)
