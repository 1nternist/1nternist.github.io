Revision history for Perl extension File-Remove

1.52 Mon 19 Mar 2012 - Adam Kennedy
	- No functional changes
	- Updating Module::Install to 1.06
	- Moved File::Spec dependency to 3.29 to fix problems with
	  four-digit decimal dependencies in some downstream packaging
	  systems.

1.51 Thu 27 Oct 2011 - Adam Kennedy
	- END-time deletion by clear() is now fork-safe, it will only remove
	  paths created in the same process.

1.50 Mon 11 Jul 2011 - Adam Kennedy
	- Adding a second skip for the known-bad cygwin file permissions problem

1.49 Wed 14 Mar 2011 - Adam Kennedy
	- Restoring 02_directoreis to no_plan as it runs different test counts
	  on different systems.

1.48 Fri 11 Mar 2011 - Adam Kennedy
	- Promoting dev code to production version
	- Fixed a major bug in the 1.46 logic that works out what to change the
	  cwd to when deleting while inside a directory.

1.47_01 Fri 18 Feb 2011 - Adam Kennedy
	- Add test counts to all test scripts
	- Added a test for space-safe globs

1.46 Fri 18 Feb 2011 - Adam Kennedy
	- No changes from 1.45_01
	- CPAN Testers likes the dev release, moving to production release

1.45_01 Thu 17 Feb 2011 - Adam Kennedy
	- Updated to Module::Install::DSL 1.00
	- Skip test on cygwin due to non-root users not being able to deny
	  themselves write permissions to files.
	- Added a test to delete directories when the current working
	  directory is inside the location to delete (ADAMK)
	- Fixes for trash() with callbacks and on Mac (MIYAGAWA)

1.42 Thu  3 Jul 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- Updated to Module::Install 0.76
	- Updated bundled author tests
	- Added the test_remove function
	- Localising $@ during eval calls

1.41 Mon  2 Jun 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- No functional changes
	- Updating location of author tests
	- Switching to Module::Install again, to generate a better META.yml

1.40 Sat 23 Feb 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- Dev release looks good, changing to production release

1.39_01 Wed 20 Feb 2008 - Adam Kennedy
	- Fixed rt.cpan.org #30251 "removing dirs enclosed by curly braces"
	- remove now ignores globbing if -e is true BEFORE globbing
	  (This should fix numerous possible failures where people are trying
	   delete strangely named files, but globbing is kicking in and
	   expanding the names incorrectly)
	- Moving to a production-grade version to indicate module stability
	- Adding explicit 5.005 dependency
	  (Primarily for the benefit of automated quality/anaylsis tools)

0.39 Mon 12 Nov 2007  - Adam Kennedy
	- No functional changes
	- Updating to Module::Install 0.68

0.38 Mon 15 Oct 2007  - Adam Kennedy
	- Removed an extremely dangerous and reckless test case that tried
	  to delete a soft link to root and (when it failed) deleted the
	  actual root directory.

0.37 Sun  8 Jul 2007  - Adam Kennedy
	- Restoring support for broken symlinks (Marek Rouchal)
	- Adding tests for the broken symlink case (Marek Rouchal)
	- Tidying up the Changes file a bit

0.36 Fri 30 Jun 2007  - Adam Kennedy
	- Avoid the installation of Mac::Glue.
	  (It should not be necesary to test voice synthesis to delete a file)
	- Anyone truly needing "trash" support will need to add a dependency
	  on Mac::Glue themself. The function may be split out of File::Remove
	  later down the track.
	- Constanting the debugger flag for a minor speed and memory improvement
	- Copy in a known-readonly flag for more accurate testing on Win32
	- Remove assumption that -w implied deletion rights on Win32
	- Validate that the file was actually deleted.
	- Add better mode-handling for files.
	- Add smarter implementation of "candelete" logic.

0.35 Fri  9 Feb 2007  (Stephen Steneker)
	- Update makefile to require Mac::Glue version compatible with Intel macs
	- Change pod heading from "methods" to "subroutines" [RT#13687]
	- No functional changes from 0.34

0.34 Mon Nov 6 2006   (Jesse Vincent)
	- Update t/03 to skip the "is this file not writable" test when
	  it would fail because the tests are being run by root (as sometimes
	  happens when installing Perl modules). 

0.33 Tue 24 Oct 2006
	- Previous release tested ok.
	- Incrementing for production release.
	- No functional changes

0.32_01 Mon 23 Oct 2006
	- Use File::Spec to clean/canon paths instead of hand-stripping trailing slash
	- Apply the File::Path "safe" check manually for the root only, and
	  use File::Path itself with safe OFF, so that we can handle deleting
	  deep readonly files (and do it properly on VMS)
	- Added a test for the deletion of deep readonly files
	- Removing the use of "our" variables to try and get the Perl version
	  dependency back to at least 5.005.
	- Report "deleted" for non-existant files they want to delete
	- Report the path they pass, but for dir USE a File::Spec->canonpath

0.31 Wed Dec 28 17:40:00 2005
	- Applied Eric Hanchrow's patch to support filenames with spaces.
	- Skip recycle tests unless recycle/trash support is available.

0.30 Wed Jul 14 19:12:00 2005
	- Applied CNANDOR's patch to fix trash() support on OS X 10.4.

0.29 Mon Dec 04 16:35:00 2004
	- Stabilize undelete support for OS X and Windows.

0.26 Mon Nov 16 07:31:00 2004
	- Fix the synopsis.

0.25 Mon Nov 15 12:04:00 2004
	- Renamed undelete() to trash(), to be more clear.
	- Allow users to provide their own rmdir/unlink to trash().
	- Re-disabled debugging by default.

0.24 Mon Nov 15 11:32:00 2004
	- Add undelete support for OS X (via Mac::Glue).
	- Fix undelete overloading of unlink/rmdir and update tests.
	- Fix the documentation to be readable with perldoc.

0.23 Mon Nov 15 09:45:00 2004
	- Add undelete supportand tests (currently only for Win32, via
	  Win32::FileOp).

0.22 Mon Nov 15 08:17:00 2004
	- Add the first set of tests.

0.21 Tue Jul 20 10:17:00 2004
	- Converted the internals to File::Spec.
	- Maintenance transferred by modules@perl.org to Richard Soderberg.
	  Please e-mail bug reports to <bug-File-Remove@rt.cpan.org>.

0.20 Tue Apr 15 23:34:25 1998
	- Now you can pass a scalar reference as the first argument and it
	  will used as the recursive flag when removing directories.  With
	  recursive flag set to 0 only the files in the directory are
	  removed and no attempt is made to recurse into subdirectories.
	  Nevertheless, if the directory becomes empty it is removed.

0.12 Tue Apr 14 15:50:56 1998
	- change the umask and set the permission on directories so we can
	  remove the files

0.11 Mon Apr 13 16:37:30 1998
	- changed the return values to successes rather than failures since
	  it makes more sense.

0.10  Fri Apr 10 22:32:13 EDT 1998
	- original version
