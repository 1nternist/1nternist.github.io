* Description

Module::Loaded

    When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
    functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided
    by external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark
    these external modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded
    by perl, this module offers you a very simple way to mark modules as
    loaded and unloaded.

#####################################################################

* Installation

Module::Loaded follows the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required.
