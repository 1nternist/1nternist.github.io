0.26  [2007-12-10]
    -   Added some more exposition on the usage of dies_ok() and lives_ok() for

    -   The optional test description for lives_and is now optional :)
    -   Can now have empty test description for throws_ok
    -   Requires Sub::Uplevel 0.13 - squashing several bugs (thanks to David

        with Cees Hek & Steve Purkis)
    -   Uses Test::Pod::Coverage rather than home grown script

        style
    -   Added link to tada list to TO DO section of documentation

        exceptions that overload "".

    -   refactored code a little

0.10  [2002-06-02]
    -   Stopped over-exuberant pod.t and documented.t checking that 
        other peoples modules were documented and had legal POD!
    -   Couple of minor tweaks to the docs.
    -   Added caller.t and patch to Exception.pm from Michael G Schwern 
        to stop dies_ok, lives_ok and throws_ok interfering with 
        caller(). Much better than the regex hack added in 0.08 --- 
        which has now been removed.

    -   Added stacktrace.t to demontrate error reported by Janek 
        Schleicher <bigj@kamelfreund.de> where a stacktrace in the

    -   Stopped stacktrace.t failing.

0.07  [2002-04-12]
    -   may_be_regex -> maybe_regex in Test::Builder

0.06
    -   couple of minor tweaks to the docs

0.05
    -   now uses may_be_regex public method from Test::Builder
    -   should work & test under 5.005, don't have a perl to hand
        to double check so feedback welcome

0.04
    -   Can now pass regex-like strings as well as regexes. Thanks to 
        Mark Fowler for the suggestion and Michael G Schwern for adding
        code to Test::Builder.

0.03  [2002-04-09]
    -   dies_ok, lives_ok & throws_ok now all return the result of the 
        underlying ok
    -   $@ is now guaranteed to be preserved (and is documented as 
        such). Thanks to Michael G Schwern for suggesting this.
    -   Tests run tainted, strict & with warnings 
        (just to be on the safe side :-)
