    - added an 'examples' directory
    
1.08 Wed Feb  6 22:43:37 EST 2008

    - added additional tests and revised documentation
    
1.07_01 Wed Jan 30 20:57:15 EST 2008

    - added support for capturing to named files instead of anonymous
      temporary ones (adapted from patch from Anton Berezin)

    - added support to pass through STDOUT or STDERR without capture while
      capturing the other one (adapted from patch from Anton Berezin)

1.0601 Sun Dec 30 17:31:31 EST 2007

    - relaxed capture_exec.t to avoid failing under noisy perl configurations

1.06 Mon, 26 Nov 2007 16:40:40 EST

    - no changes from 1.05_53

1.05_53 Sat Nov 17 18:45:08 EST 2007

    - MSVC++ fixes for Inline::C testing breaks on other compilers; this
      version uses separate C routines for MSVC++ and other compilers

1.05_52 Sat Nov 17 14:47:52 EST 2007

    - changed Inline::C code for printing to stdout to match that for stderr;
      works around a bug if the intalled MSVC++ version doesn't match the
      version used to build ActiveState Perl on MSWin32.
      
1.05_51 Sat Nov 17 13:36:39 EST 2007

    - changed Inline::C code for printing to stderr to attempt to work around
      a segfault bug on some MSWin32 systems (Alternative described by 
      BrowserUK at http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=649021 )

    - minor Perl::Critic cleanup to pass xt tests

1.05 Fri Nov 16 08:44:06 EST 2007

    *** No changes since 1.04_03; key changes since 1.03 follows ***

    - added support for capture() merging STDERR and STDOUT to the same
      scalar, i.e. "capture( \&foo, \$out, \$out )" (RT#24695)

    - added capture_exec_combined() and alias qxy() to merge STDERR and STDOUT
      for subprocess execution (RT#29289)
    
    - bugfix: stop crashing if output filehandles are previously closed or
      if running without a console on MSWin32 (i.e. wperl.exe) (RT#23676)

    - bugfix: capture.t would fail on Win32 if Inline::C was installed; 
      fixed the sample C code used in testing to flush stderr (RT#21712)

    - bugfix: was failing on perl 5.8.0 due to extraneous space in call 
      to open(); removing the space fixed the bug (RT#22044)

1.04_03 Sun Nov  4 11:35:57 EST 2007

    - suppress warnings included in captured output when console output
      handles were previously closed; only affects some versions/builds of 
      perl on some platforms (found by Slaven Rezic 5.6.2 on FreeBSD 6.2)
      
1.04_02 Wed Oct 31 00:52:49 EDT 2007

      for subprocess execution (RT#29289)
