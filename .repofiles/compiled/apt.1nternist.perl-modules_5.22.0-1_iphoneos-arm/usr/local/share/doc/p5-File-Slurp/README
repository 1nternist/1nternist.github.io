File::Slurp.pm
===========================

This module provides subroutines to read or write entire files with a
simple call.  It also has a subroutine for reading the list of filenames
in a directory.

In the extras/ directory you can read an article (slurp_article.pod)
about file slurping and also run a benchmark (slurp_bench.pl) that
compares many ways of slurping/spewing files. This benchmark was
rewritten for .14 and is much better.

This module was first written and owned by David Muir Sharnoff (MUIR on
CPAN).  I checked out his module and decided to write a new version
which would be faster and with many more features.  To that end, David
graciously transfered the namespace to me.

There have been some comments about the somewhat unusual version number.
The problem was that David used a future date (2004.0904) in his version
number, and the only way I could get CPAN to index my new module was to
make it have a version number higher than the old one, so I chose the
9999 prefix and appended the real revision number to it.
