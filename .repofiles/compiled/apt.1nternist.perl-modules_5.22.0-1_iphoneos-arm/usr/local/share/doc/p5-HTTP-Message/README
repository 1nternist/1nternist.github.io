The HTTP-Message distribution contains classes useful for representing the
messages passed in HTTP style communication.  These are classes representing
requests, responses and the headers contained within them.

The following classes are provided:

    HTTP::Message         base class (what's common between requests and responses)
    - HTTP::Request       request on a resource (subclass of message)
    - HTTP::Response      response from the resource (subclass of message)
    HTTP::Headers         headers embedded in messages

Other related modules:

    HTTP::Config          configuration of request/response handling
    HTTP::Headers::Util   helper functions for parsing of HTTP header values
    HTTP::Request::Common helper functions for constructing requests
    HTTP::Status          symbolic names for the HTTP response status codes
