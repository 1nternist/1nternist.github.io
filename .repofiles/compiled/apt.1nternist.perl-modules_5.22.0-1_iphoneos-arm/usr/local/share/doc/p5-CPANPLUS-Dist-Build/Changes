    during the 'install' test. local::lib and cpanm set these.

0.48 Sun Sep  5 15:14:17 BST 2010
  - Explicitly set the location of cpanp-run-perl when under PERL_CORE
    in t/inc/conf.pl

0.46 Sat Jan 23 07:52:19 GMT 2010
  - actually make the prereq resolving fallback to _build/ querying
    if the 'prereq_data' action fails. *facepalm*

0.44 Wed Nov 18 12:37:03 GMT 2009
  - Make the prereq resolving fallback to _build/ querying

0.38 Mon Aug 24 13:59:11 BST 2009
  - Cosmetic change to the test output message so it
    matches CPANPLUS::Dist::MM (bingos)

0.36 Sat Jul  4 14:51:42 BST 2009
  - Make install() honour the buildflags directive, 
    absence spotted by Matt Trout

0.35_03 Tue Jun 30 22:48:57 BST 2009
  - Switch to IPC::Cmd->can_capture_buffer wherever we 
    need to rely on what is captured ( VMS and MSWin32 
    currently ).
  - Make sure to use perlwrapper for Build.PL on VMS

0.35_02 Sat Jun 27 09:35:55 BST 2009
  - Don't use the perlwrapper on VMS, (Craig Berry)
  - Skip env test on VMS

0.35_01 Wed Jun 24 09:57:28 BST 2009
  - Fix to _find_prereqs() for VMS when running prereq_data
    Build target, reported by Craig Berry.

0.34 Sat Jun 13 09:50:24 BST 2009
  - Fixed the 02packages.details.txt.gz file in our fake CPAN
      CPANPLUS-0.87_01 now checks this file for sanity. Ours
      was not sane >:) Spotted by the ever vigilant Vincent Pit.

0.32 Mon Jun  1 21:43:52 BST 2009
  - Removed generation of .output files

0.28 Fri May  8 10:58:42 BST 2009
  - Add the CPANPLUS bin/ dir to $ENV{PATH} if we are running
    under PERL_CORE. This fixes warnings during 'make test' in
    the core. No need for other users to upgrade.

0.26 Thu May  7 16:40:26 BST 2009
  - Integrated the t/inc/conf.pl and dummy-CPAN/ structure from
    CPANPLUS into the testsuite. This resolves the issue where 
    CPAN indexes were fetched and built during the tests. 
    Spotted by Steve Hay, fixed with help from Jos Boumans.

0.24 Mon Apr 27 16:55:37 BST 2009
  - Removed CPANPLUS::inc from the code as CPANPLUS-0.86 does not

0.20 Tue Apr  7 17:01:47 BST 2009

0.06_03	Mon Feb  9 16:31:10 GMT 2009

 - process separation for Build.PL, Build, test and install actions, 
   using IPC::Cmd (bingos)
 - If M::B is version 0.31_03 or greater use 'Build prereq_data' to
   work out prereqs, otherwise fallback on poking around in _build/
   like CPAN.pm does. (bingos)
 - Resolved issues with test reports for FAILs being misgraded as UKNOWN. (bingos)

   changes in this release; users need not upgrade.

0.04  Wed Aug 16 22:00:18 CDT 2006

 - Address RT #13926: build_requires not included in prerequisites

   Description?

 - Address RT #13937 Won't install without force because newer 
   version installed (from CPANPLUS 0.055?)

 - Update dependency versions in Makefile.PL
  
 - We were sending cpantesters 'pass' reports whenever --force was in
   effect, which is probably not the right thing to do. [Jos Boumans]
