* Description

CPANPLUS::Dist::Build

    CPANPLUS::Dist::Build is a distribution class for Module::Build
    related modules.
    Using this package, you can create, install and uninstall perl
    modules. It inherits from CPANPLUS::Dist.
    
    Normal users won't have to worry about the interface to this module,
    as it functions transparently as a plug-in to CPANPLUS and will 
    just Do The Right Thing when it's loaded.

#####################################################################

* Installation

CPANPLUS::Dist::Build follows the standard perl module install process

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The module uses no C or XS parts, so no c-compiler is required.
