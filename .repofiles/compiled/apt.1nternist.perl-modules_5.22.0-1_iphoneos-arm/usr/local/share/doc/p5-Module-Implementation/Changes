- Require Module::Runtime 0.012 which has a number of useful bug fixes.


0.05     2012-02-09

- Make Test::Taint an optional dependency. This module requires XS, and
  requiring a compiler for Module::Implementation defeats its
  purpose. Reported by Peter Rabbitson. RT #74817.


0.04     2012-02-08

- This module no longer installs an _implementation() subroutine in
  callers. Instead, you can call
  Module::Implementation::implementation_for($package) to get the
  implementation used for a given package.


0.03     2012-02-06

- The generated loader sub now returns the name of the package it loaded.


0.02     2012-02-06

- Removed Test::Spelling from this module's prereqs.
