NAME

    constant - Perl pragma to declare constants


DESCRIPTION

    This pragma allows you to declare constants at compile-time.

    When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its
    value at compile time, and may then optimize the expression further.
    In particular, any code in an "if (CONSTANT)" block will be optimized
    away if the constant is false.
