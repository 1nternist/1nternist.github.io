0.01_05 2011-09-20
  - Correct maximal subpart implementation
    An initial subsequence of a ill-formed sequence is not maximal subpart.

    <C0 80>       -> <FFFD FFFD>
    <ED A0 80>    -> <FFFD FFFD FFFD>
    <EF BF BF>    -> <FFFD>
    <F4 80 80>    -> <FFFD>
    <F4 90 80 80> -> <FFFD FFFD FFFD FFFD>

    Unicode v6.0:
    D93b Maximal subpart of an ill-formed subsequence: The longest code unit
    subsequence starting at an unconvertible offset that is either:
      a. the initial subsequence of a well-formed code unit sequence, or
      b. a subsequence of length one.

0.01_04 2011-09-17
  - croak if Perl's internal representation of wide characters is ill-formed.
  - Fixed a bug in replacement handling.
  - Added a test for replacement handling.

  - Instead of just croaking use the 'utf8' warnings category and 
    leave the choise of error reporting to the user.
  - Maximal subpart of an ill-formed subsequence is replaced with U+FFFD as 
    recomended by Unicode.

0.01_02 2011-09-13

    to "Can't represent \w+ code point",
  - Added a taint test.
  - Added a leaks test.
