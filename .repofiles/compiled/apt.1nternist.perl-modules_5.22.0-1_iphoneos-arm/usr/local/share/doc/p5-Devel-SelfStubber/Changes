1.05  Wed, 15 Dec 2010 20:25:23 +0100
  * Install to the right part of @INC on old perls.

1.04  Sat, 11 Dec 2010 15:27:23 +0100
  * Depend on SelfLoader 1.0903, which is the first version that ensures text
    after __END__ survives, which we need for our tests to pass. This
    effectively makes us 5.8-only, as recent enough versions of SelfLoader
    aren't available for 5.6.

1.03  Thu, 09 Dec 2010 21:13:12 +0100
  * First upload to cpan. Identical with version 1.03 in the perl core. Upstream
    for this module is still blead perl.
