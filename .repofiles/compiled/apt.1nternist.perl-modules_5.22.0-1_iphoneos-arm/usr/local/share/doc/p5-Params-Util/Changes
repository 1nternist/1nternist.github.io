Revision history for Perl extension Params-Util

1.07 Sun 11 Mar 2012
	- Disable XS version on cygwin as it shows bizarre behaviour
	  that breaks form when using Params::Util XS verwion.

1.06 Thu 1 Mar 2012
	- Remove the need for the sanexs.c file by generating into a temp
	  file instead.

1.05 Thu 1 Mar 2012
	- Restore compatibility with pre-5.8.8 Perls without a working
	  compiler available install time (RIBASUSHI)

1.04 Wed 20 Apr 2011
	- Fixed #67522 have_compiler returns

1.03 Mon 22 Nov 2010
	- No CPAN Testers failures, moving to production release

1.02_01 Thu 16 Sep 2010
	- Trying for a much more advanced can_xs() alternative to can_cc()
	  to deal with the situation where a host has a superficially
	  working compiler, but completely screwed up headers.
	- Adding some fallback strategies to deal with cases where these
	  same machines don't support configure_requires.
	- Adopt Chorny's eumm-upgrade style for the Makefile.PL.
	- Allow the Makefile.PL to build it's own META.yml now.

1.01 Thu 18 Mar 2010
        - Fixed can_cc() bug in Makefile.PL where it was checking an existence
          of PATH directory rather than executables. RT#55668 (DGOLDEN, MIYAGAWA)

1.00 Sun 31 May 2009
	- Now all known XS bugs are worked out, I've removed
	  the experimental flags and set that as the first 1+ release.
	- Fixed XS implementation of _*LIKE and _INSTANCE
	- Added test for a negative custom isa returning ('')
	- Improving the 'clean' file list in a Makefile.PL

0.38 Tue 17 Feb 2009
	- Fix _IDENTIFIER to return false for "foo\n" (ZEFRAM)
	- Fix _CLASS to return false for "foo\n" (ZEFRAM)

0.37 Wed  4 Feb 2009
	- Fix _HASH for bleadperl (patch from RAFL)
	- Fix regex (more) for bleadperl (patch from RAFL)

0.36 Fri 30 Jan 2009
	- Fixing the overload for _REGEX
	- Adding the tests for _REGEX
	- Reorganising the Makefile.PL
	- Adding duplicate tests for when the XS version isn't compiled

0.35 Tue 11 Nov 2008
	- No changes
	- CPAN Testers results look good, moving to production version

0.34_01 Mon  3 Nov 2008
	- Adding experimental XS implementation by the awesome Jens Rehsack

0.33 Tue 27 May 2008
	- Upgrading to Module::Install 0.74
	- Bumping Scalar::Util version to 1.18 to get a fixed better looks_like_number
	- Moved B driver test class to My_B to prevent collision with the B modules

0.32_01 Sat 23 Feb 2008
	- Moving 01_compile.t minimum version to 5.005 to match Makefile.PL
	  (Resolves rt.cpan.org #26674)
	- Removing the deprecated _CALLABLE function

0.31 Wed 14 Nov 2007
	- Upgrading to Module::Install 0.68

0.30 Mon 22 Oct 2007
	- Incremental release to get a newer and non-broken version of the
	  author-only tests.

0.29 Thu 23 Aug 2007
	- Correcting a test which only ran under AUTOMATED_TESTING,
	  apparently my release automation isn't doing what I think
	  it is doing.

0.28 Sat 18 Aug 2007
	- Dropping the Perl version requirement in 01_compile.t to 5.004

0.27 Sat 18 Aug 2007
	- Skipping one particularly evil test that we know fails on a few OS
	  unless AUTOMATED_TESTING is enabled.
	  These failures weren't worth preventing installation at all.

0.26 Fri 27 Jul 2007
	- Adding the _NONNEGINT function

0.25 Mon 14 May 2007
	- Adding the _CLASSISA and _SUBCLASS functions to fill
	  a gap between _CLASS and _DRIVER

0.24 Wed  9 May 2007
	- Adding the _DRIVER function for use in writing driver APIs

0.23 Tue 20 Feb 2007
        - Bug fix to _INVOCANT to handle false classes.

0.22 Wed  1 Nov 2006
	- Bug fix to _CODELIKE to handle CODE refs properly
	- Updating tests to work more accurately in this regard.

0.21 Tue 10 Oct 2006
	- When no compiler available, minimise the dependency on Scalar::Util,
	  because it's better to leave them with a slightly leaky version
	  than to fail altogether.

0.20 Tue 26 Sep 2006
	- Advanced deprecation of _CALLABLE to "warn but work".
	- Correctly refer to _CALLABLE being deprecated, not _CODELIKE.
	- Add support for Tie::Handle objects to _HANDLE
	- Add support for IO::Scalar objects to _HANDLE
	- Add support for IO::String objects to _HANDLE

0.19 Thu 14 Sep 2006
	- Adding more Scalar::Util tests, this time with some diagnostics

0.18 Thu 14 Sep 2006
	- Explicitly importing refaddr in t/07_handle.t to fix
          test failure on ActivePerl 5.8.0.
	- Increased Scalar::Util dep to 1.14 because we may well
	  be hurt by tied handles-related bug.

0.17 Tue  8 Aug 2006
	- Adding experimental _HANDLE implementation

0.16 Sun  2 Jul 2006
	- We don't check for stash definedness for _INVOCANT.
	  (This is required for 5.005 compat.)

0.15 Sun  2 Jul 2006
	# This release contains only build-time changes
	- Updating to Module::Install 0.63 to add 5.004 support (sorta)
	- Dropping version dependency to 5.004 (Ricardo Signes)

0.14 Wed 10 May 2006
	- No features() used in this dist, so removing auto_install
	- Moved _CALLABLE to _CODELIKE for symmetry reasons. Sorry :(
	  Immediate doc changover. Silent alias for a month, then
	  warning alias for 3 months, then full deprecation at the end
	  of August.
	- Removed RJBS's use warnings that broke 5.005-compatibility.
	- Other minor test cleanups.

0.13 Sun May  7 2006
	# This release contains only build-time changes
