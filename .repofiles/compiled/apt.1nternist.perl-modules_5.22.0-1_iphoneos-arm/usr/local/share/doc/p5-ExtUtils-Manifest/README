ExtUtils::Manifest provides a number of utilities to 
write and check a MANIFEST file. At present the list includes
mkmanifest, manicheck, filecheck, fullcheck, skipcheck,
manifind, maniread, manicopy, and maniadd.

To install, execute the sequence

   perl Makefile.PL
   $MAKE
   $MAKE test
   $MAKE install

where $MAKE is the make program appropriate for your system.
Alternatively, if you have Module::Build installed, you can do

  perl Build.PL
  perl Build
  perl Build test
  perl Build install
