Revision history for Perl extension Math::BigInt::FastCalc.

2011-02-06 0.251 pjacklam (7558 tests)
  * Add requirement Math::BigInt version 1.991 (Peter John Acklam).

2011-02-05 0.25 pjacklam (7558 tests)
  * Remove _new() from XS code and use _new() in Math::BigInt::Calc
    instead. The XS _new() doesn't handle integers that are too large to
    be represented exactly as floating point numbers, but small enough
    to be represented as 64 bit integers. The XS _new() also returns
    nan, not inf, when it overflows. This closes RT #63335 and RT #49569
    (Peter John Acklam).
  * Copied test files from latest Math::BigInt (v1.991): bigfltpm.inc,
    bigfltpm.t, bigintpm.inc, bigintpm.t, mbi_rand.t, mbimbf.inc,
    mbimbf.t (Peter John Acklam).

2010-11-07 0.24 rafl (6938 tests)
  * Reduce repetition (and object size) in FastCalc.xs by using ALIASes
    (Nicholas Clark).
  * inline the macros CONSTANT_OBJ and RETURN_MORTAL_BOOL. (Nicholas Clark).
  * Avoid creating two entries instead of one on the mortals stack in _new() and
    _zero() (Nicholas Clark).
  * Convert from DynaLoader to XSLoader (Nicholas Clark).
  * Adapt to the changed order of the return value Math::BigInt::Calc::_base_len
    in Math::BigInt 1.97 (Nicholas Clark).
  * Initialise BASE and BASE_LEN as part of bootstrap, avoiding special one-shot
    setter routines (Nicholas Clark).
  * Remove the $BASE or $BASE_LEN globals. They were never documented or
    exported, and are now unnecessary (Nicholas Clark).

2010-09-14 0.22 rafl (6938 tests)
  * Modernize the test suite to use Test::More instead of Test.

2010-09-03 0.21 rafl (6892 tests)
  * Remove some unneeded test code which only broke things when being ran in the
    perl core.

2010-09-03 0.20 rafl (6892 tests)
  * Avoid certain kinds of segfaults as well as wrong bnok() behaviour by
    depending on Math::BigInt 0.90.

2007-09-16 0.16 Tels (6892 tests)

2007-04-09 0.13 Tels (6280 tests)
  * require Math::BigInt 1.82
  * revert the accidentily change to "NV elems" in _len
    (basically, apply the fix that was already in blead to the CPAN release)
  * plug all the leaks in _acmp(), _is_ten() etc. (Thanx Hugo!)

2007-03-03 0.12 Tels (6280 tests)
  * fix bug #25033 It leaks (Thanx M. Schwern!)

Older changelog:

0.01  Wed Jun  5 13:03:55 2002
        - original version; created by h2xs 1.21 with options
                -n Math::BigInt::FastCalc -A
2002-08-09 0.02 Tels
  - first working version of XS code of _is_even(), _is_odd()

2002-08-12 0.03 Tels
  - Took Calc.pm and converted it to FastCalc.pm
  - first two functions, _is_odd() and _is_even() in XS
  - testsuite from MBI v1.61
  - extended bigintc.t (also renamed to bigintfc.t)

2002-08-13 0.04 Tels first release
  - added is_zero(), is_one(), _zero(), _one(), _two() and _acmp()
  - more tests in bigintfc.t

  Some general observations:
  * is_*() methods are quite a bit faster than in Calc, but due to the
    overhead in Math::BigInt real programs will get only a bit faster
    (around 2-5%).
  * Comparisation is *much* faster, and even via Math::BigInt improves the
    performance by about factor 9 for large numbers. For smaller numbers (less
    than 8000 digits) it is still about factor 2.5 to 8. This is only valid if
    the numbers have both the same length. If the length is different, then
    FastCalc is still about a factor of 1.2 to 1.7 faster than Calc.

2002-08-13 0.05 Tels (5224 tests)
  * the note that "_len() and _acmp() are in XS" was missing
  * cleaned distribution of unwanted files

2002-08-25 0.06 Tels (5355 tests)
  * working _modinv() and fix for _rsft() taken over from Calc v0.32
  * added tests for _rsft() and _modinv()
  * require Math::BigInt v1.62
  * _num(), _dec() and _inc() are now in XS
    $MBI->numify() is about 50% faster
    $MBI->binc()/$MBI->bdec() are about 5-8% faster for numbers that don't
    overflow (much), and about 14% for ('9' x 100)->binc()
  * __strip_zeros() is no in XS, making it roughly 3 times as fast
  * added _copy(): more than twice as fast for large (> 1000 digits) numbers:
