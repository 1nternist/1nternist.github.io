0.15 Wed 12 Nov 2008
    - when use_ext is true, we will check to see if there are no supported
      modules for a particular file. instead of the file being skipped, an
      error will be thrown (RT #38927).
    - also, when use_ext is true, a fatal error will be thrown if there are
      no loaders available that understand the file extension.
    - officially support multiple loaders per extension
    - add a Config::Any::Base for all loaders to inherit from, plus add
      a new dependency mechanism: requires_any_of() and requires_all_of().
    - filter out loaders that don't inherit from Config::Any::Base (RT #40830)

0.09_01 Tue Nov 13 2007
    - code and pod cleanups
    - use_ext is now on by default
    - when use_ext is on, if a loader throws an error, we throw an error
    - fix case where use_ext is defined and false, but was behaving like
      use_ext => 1

    - each plugin now has an is_supported() method which helps us figure out
      if the right modules are available
