NAME
    CPAN::Meta::YAML - Read and write a subset of YAML for CPAN Meta files

VERSION
    version 0.008

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::Meta::YAML;

        # reading a META file
        open $fh, "<:utf8", "META.yml";
        $yaml_text = do { local $/; <$fh> };
        $yaml = CPAN::Meta::YAML->read_string($yaml_text)
          or die CPAN::Meta::YAML->errstr;

        # finding the metadata
        $meta = $yaml->[0];

        # writing a META file
        $yaml_text = $yaml->write_string
          or die CPAN::Meta::YAML->errstr;
        open $fh, ">:utf8", "META.yml";
        print $fh $yaml_text;

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a subset of the YAML specification for use in
    reading and writing CPAN metadata files like META.yml and MYMETA.yml. It
    should not be used for any other general YAML parsing or generation
    task.

    NOTE: META.yml (and MYMETA.yml) files should be UTF-8 encoded. Users are
    responsible for proper encoding and decoding. In particular, the "read"
    and "write" methods do not support UTF-8 and should not be used.

SUPPORT
    This module is currently derived from YAML::Tiny by Adam Kennedy. If
    there are bugs in how it parses a particular META.yml file, please file
    a bug report in the YAML::Tiny bugtracker:
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=YAML-Tiny>
