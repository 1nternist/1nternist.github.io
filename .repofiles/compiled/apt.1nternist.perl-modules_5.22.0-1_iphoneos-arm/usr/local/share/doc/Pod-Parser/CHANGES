ATTENTION!

Before using this for any _new_ software, please consider using Pod::Simple,
it is a modern replacement for this module.

 + missed one (important) line from one of the patches below in pod2usage2.t
   No change in the *.pm files

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.37
 + fixed resource links in META.yml
 + address CPAN#42695 with a minor change in PlainText, although not solving
   it completely; the 'loose' option now applies to all =headN headings
 + address failures of find.t on Win32 (cpantesters) - root cause was a 
   mismatch of directory names like "Progra~1" (short/long file names)
 + include the following bleadperl changes:
   * Blank lines "between" verbatim sections are now acceptible:
     http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/caa547d
   * Be less picky about what constitutes "numeric lists" in Pod:
     http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/4df4f5d
   * Changes made to contains_pod.t when upgrading to 1.34:
     http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/fb59f97
   * Fix paths on new pod2usage2 tests to work in the core.
     http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/222046efb22c183703fea2b30db76296ab782e89
   * Make t/pod/pod2usage2.t work on case insensitive file systems.
     http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/767c16ab361d1225fb153423fb22b590c1e0c7ea
   Thanks to Nicholas Clark, Steve Hay, Jerry D. Hedden for the patches

 Version 1.36
 - Did I say this package is dead, and there won't be any updates?

 + CPAN#23618: replace $Config{privlib} with privlibexp to avoid problems
   with installation paths like ~user. Thanks clonezone for the patch
 + CPAN#24983: document that parse_from_file() accepts also file handle
   references and objects that support the regular IO interfaces
 + added a little tweaking of Test::Builder to pod2usage2.t, which 
   should solve the problem with older Perls (5.005)

   appears, even when using perldoc
 + CPAN#35514: add some documentation and a test to demonstrate how
   pod2usage works together with Pod::Find::pod_where to show module PODs

   SYNOPSIS. Thanks dwierenga AT valueclick DOT com for the patch
 + CPAN#38747: two important bug fixes and one improvement, all around
   pod2usage(-sections). Many thanks David DOT Purdie AT erggroup DOT com
   for the patches and suggestions. This fixes also CPAN#41136
 + CPAN#41135: allow subheadings in OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS and 
   pod2usage(-verbose => 1) - they are now printed as well
 + CPAN#42141: find.t fix for VMS in UNIX compatible mode. Thanks a lot
   malmberg AT Encompasserve org for the patch
 + Fixed inconsistencies between Pod::PlainText and Pod::Text regarding
   selection of sections; now both should work according to the docs of
   Pod::Usage
 + verified on perl 5.8.8, 5.8.7, 5.6.1, 5.005.03 on Solaris 8 (Sparc),
   perl 5.6.1, 5.8.7 on RedHat Linux 7.2,

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.34
 + yi luo luoyi.ly at gmail.com noticed that -x _ does not do the right
   thing on Windoze with *.bat files, where -x $file does
 + JHOBLITT at cpan.org sent a patch to make contains_pod accept files that
   start with =head on the first line. Test integrated with slight modifications
   (to avoid dependency on File::Temp and others) (CPAN#14871)
 + applied http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=25588
   (thanks H.Merijn Brand and Rafael Garcia-Suarez)
 Neverending story...

 I hope this will do now - Pod-Parser is DEAD!


 15-Jun-2005           Marek Rouchal                        <marekr@cpan.org>

   $_), which significantly reduces runtime (CPAN#12327)
 + fixed regression in podselect.PL and pod2usage.PL reported by Steve Peters 
   steve AT fisharerojo.org; no change in the actual code, just the build
   script; the fix in Pod::Usage was already in
 + downgraded error about nested styles (e.g. C<...C<...>...>) to a warning
   (CPAN#12240)
 + added the brackets to gensym() to make use strict happy in Perls < 5.006
   (CPAN#5613)
 + pod2usage() is more tolerant wrt. =head1 SYNOPSIS\s* (CPAN#6329)
 + require at least File::Spec 0.82 as suggested in CPAN#8709

   This is the last time an enhancement was implemented! >:->
 + fixed the test t/pod/find.t to not depend on perlfunc (CPAN#6679);
   now the test also uses t/pod/testpods/lib/Pod/Stuff.pm;
   this implicitely fixes also CPAN#8742
 + slightly updated META.yml
 + made sure that CPAN#7486 is _really_ integrated
 + make -quiet DWIM in Pod::Checker (CPAN#11884)


 12-Mar-2005           Marek Rouchal                        <marekr@cpan.org>

   in consequence updated Pod::PlainText and some t/...xr


 27-Aug-2003           Marek Rouchal                        <marekr@cpan.org>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 26-Aug-2003           Marek Rouchal                        <marekr@cpan.org>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.24
 + removed the "BETA STAGE" from Pod::Checker - it is now stable

   core pods in pods/ - fixed in Pod::Find
 + changed the logic in Pod::InputObjects a bit to speed up the parser,

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.21
 + fixed a bug in the find.t test
 + make test work ok on MacOS/darwin, which strangely enough has its
   perlfunc.pod in a "pods" directory, rather than "pod"


 31-Oct-2002           Marek Rouchal                        <marekr@cpan.org>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.20
 + Merged changes of perl-5.8.0 core back into this distribution:
   - MacOS specific changes
   - english orthography corrections
   - adaptations to perlpodspec (e.g. =over does not require argument)
 + Adapt the link text to perlpodspec (drop extra text like
   `elsewhere in this document', `the ... manpage' etc.)
 + Allow dashes in Pod hyperlinks, e.g. L<Inline::C-Cookbook>
   (on request by Slaven Rezic and Mark Overmeer)


 29-Aug-2002           Marek Rouchal                        <marekr@cpan.org>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.19

 + Fixed spurious warning in Pod::ParseUtils reported by Rafael Garcia-Suarez 
   <rgarciasuarez@free.fr>: Inside "" the characters | and / are ok
 + Added a num_warnings method to Pod::Checker - requested by
   brian d foy <comdog@panix.com>
 + Added a warning if =head2 comes before a =head1 - one TODO item less!

 01-Sep-2000           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.18
 + Fixed error in failing recognize empty C<<  >> sequences
 + Modified pod2usage to use perldoc if ultra-verbose mode is set
   and input is a filename and output is STDOUT (so now it doesnt just
   print the manpage, it pretty prints it and paginates it)
 + Allowed -exitval => NOEXIT to be given to pod2usage to instruct it
   NOT to exit the running script.
 + Applied VMS patches from Tim Jennes to t/pod/find.t and lib/Pod/Find.pm

 25-Jul-2000           Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>

   Pod::Find and t/pod/find.t
 + extended logic in Pod::Find to search for pod/ subdirectories in all

   Thus pod_where could be used by perldoc.
 + added check for recent File::Spec version in Makefile.PL
 + updated Makefile.PL, CHANGES, README

 07-Jul-2000           Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.16
 + included two subs suggested by Tim Jenness <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu>
   in Pod::Find (pod_where and contains_pod) and included a test in
   t/pod/find.t
 + updated Makefile.PL, CHANGES and TODO


 03-Jul-2000           Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.15
 + introduced -quiet option for Pod::Checker to suppress diagnostic
   output when Pod::Checker is used to eat POD and output text.
 + improved documentation in Pod::Checker
 + improved code coverage of t/pod/poderrs.t
 + updated TODO


 04-Jun-2000           Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.14
 + fixed wrong value in Pod::Parser concerning whitespace lines
 + added check in podchecker whether argument is a directory
 + introduce additional warning level: this suppresses the complaints
   about unescaped <>, but the check is enabled when the wrning level is
   increased: podchecker -warn -warn
   adapted documentation appropriately
 + Pod::Hyperlink now parses L<open(2)> again, but gives a warning. The
   calling programs have to check themselves for what to do with pages
   like open(2).
 + Changed POD of several modules so that they conform to podchecker :-)


 14-Mar-2000           Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>

 + Improved support of Win32 and OS/2 platforms by using File::Spec in
   Pod::Find
 + strip .bat and .cmd on Win32 and OS/2, respectively
 + removed all tabs from Pod::Find and reviewed POD documentation
 + finally fixed t/pod/ptestpchk.pl to ignore any and all non-word-chars
   in pathnames. No more special casing filenames for MacOS, NT, VMS, etc
   just for the sake of passing the t/pod/poderrs.t test!


 11-Mar-2000           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>

 21-Feb-2000           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>
                       Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.093
 + Pod::Parser now warns about non-empty blank lines matching /^\s+$/
 + got rid of special handling of '=>' and '=>' inside C<..> and instead
   implemented the more general rules posted by Larry Wall on P5P allowing
   /[A-Z]<...>/ and /[A-Z]<[<:]\s+...\s+[:>]>/ to deal with things like
   embedded '->' and '=>' using whitespace, as in: C<< <=> >> and I<< <> >>.
 + added proposals by Wolfgang Laun to Pod::Checker (more errors and 
   warnings):
    - removed qr// so that code runs with Perl 5.004 
    - POD files can include '.' in the name.
    - L<DBI(3)> now causes an error, correct is: L<DBI>


 03-Jan-2000           Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>

 + moved helper code to new module Pod::ParseUtils, added documentation
 + added Pod::Find, along with a test


 22-Oct-1999           Marek Rouchal      <marek@saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.090
 + Added several additional checks to Pod::Checker
 + Pod::Checker detects files with no POD
 + Pod::Checker prints warnings about inproper style
 + Modified podchecker to use the -warnings option and the "empty POD"
   status
 + Added Pod::Hyperlink (internal in Pod::Checker for now) that parses
   the L<> sequence into alttext, page and section
 + Updated documentation
 + Started adding callbacks so that Pod::Checker can be used also for
   single-pass POD translators in the future

 25-Sep-1999           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.085

 + Added the '-want_nonPODs' parse-option
 + Added the '-process_cut_cmd' parse-option

 + Added Russ Allbery's Pod::PlainText re-write
 + Added some tests contributed by Russ Allbery
 + Fixed Makefile.PL to install the supplied scripts
 + Updated copyright messages
 + Added an error/warning callback function to Pod::Parser. When specified,
   it will call the user-provided function instead of "warn" when printing
   error messages (This makes it easier for things like Pod::Checker to
   capture and/or redirect error output). See Pod::Parser::errorsub().

 28-Jun-1999           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.081
 + Fixed warning message in Pod::Parser::parse_text when $expand_seq is undef.
 + Fixed another problem with ignoring the contents of an interior sequence
   if it was nothing but ')' inside the angle brackets (e.g. C<0>).
 + Moved test files under t/ to t/pod, and added a subdirectory t/pod/xtra
   for the extra tests that involve "included" files and processing its
   own source (the "xtra" files are *not* part of what comes with the CORE
   in Perl 5.006)
 + Munged the Makefile.PL to be able to set TEST_FILES to t/pod/*.t and
   t/pod/xtra/*.t (if it exists). This requires File::Spec so now you
   need either File::Spec or Perl 5.005 or later to install this.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.08
 + Fixed a bug in obtaining options-hash in pod2usage()
 + Modified test suite & tools to run as expected on more platforms
   (the .t scripts now do a zero-exit if $ENV{ACTIVE_HARNESS} is set)
 + Some more portability fixes for searching file-paths in Pod::Usage
   (thanks to Chris Nandor)
 + Changed the distribution directory structure a little bit. Instead
   of all the scripts and modules at the top level directory, the scripts
   are now in the 'scripts/' subdirectory and the modules are now in the
   'lib/Pod/' subdirectory.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.07
 + Added Pod::Checker and podchecker.PL
 + Fixed line-counting errors in Pod::Parser::parse_from_filehandle()
 + Added raw_text method for Pod::ParseTree
 + Documented optional hash-ref arg to Pod::Parser::parse_text and replaced
   '-expand' with '-expand_seq' and '-expand_ptree'
 + parse_text now has sequences point to the parents they are nested inside
   of as soon as they are created (instead of after they are appended to
   the parent, which may occur *after* expansion)
 + Added the regression test-suite to the distribution in the t/ subdirectory.
   Its not very exhaustive, but its a start.
 + Now uses File::Spec, which is bundled with perl 5.005 and later, but if
   you have perl 5.004 you may need to download File::Spec from CPAN

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.061
 + Minor additions to v1.06
   * Pod::InteriorSequence::nested was buried inside POD directives.
     I had to add the `=cut' between the subroutine docs and its code.

   * Removed some of the documentation for things in Pod::Parser and
     Pod::Input object that the user probably doesnt need to know.

   * Split out "CHANGES" and "TODO" into separate files from the README

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.06
 + SIGNIFICANT CHANGES (POSSIBLE BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES)
   * Pod::InputObjects::ParseTree object ADDED. This object corresponds
     to a parse-tree of parsed pod paragraph text. Every node in the
     parse-tree is either a text-string, or a Pod::InteriorSequence
     that has yet to be expanded.

   * Pod::Parser::parse_text ADDED!!! This routine parses some pod input
     text and returns a parse-tree as the result. This is VERY useful for
     people who cant rely on strict bottom-up expansion of interior
     sequences. Now they can get the parse-tree and expand sequences
     themselves in whatever order they require.

   * Pod::Parser::interpolate PARAMETER CHANGE, it *no* *longer* takes a
     regexp as its second parameter!!!  It used to accept a regular
     expression signifying the end of parsing conditions and pass it to
     _interpolate_bottom_up.  It now takes a line-number as the second
     arg.

   * Pod::Parser::_interpolate_bottom_up has been *REMOVED*!! Pod::Parser
     no longer uses a recursive routine to parse interior sequences.

   * The following Pod::Parser subroutines now take the current line-number
     as an ADDITIONAL PARAMETER: command, textblock, verbatim, interpolate,
     preprocess_line, preprocess_paragraph, parse_paragraph.

   * REMOVED the Pod::Parser::total_lines method

   * ADDED the nested() method to Pod::InteriorSequence

   * REMOVED the following methods from Pod::InputSource: num_lines,
     file_line, and ADDED the method filename instead.

   * REMOVED the _CMD_SEQUENCES data-field and sequences() method from
     Pod::Parser.  If you need to know the parent of a nested interior
     sequence, then invoke the nested() method of that sequence.

 + OTHER CHANGES
   - Added the "-pathlist" options to Pod::Usage and pod2usage
   - Made Pod::Usage a tad more portable for DOS and MSWin32
   - Got rid of a rogue '#' in podselect that was in front of a needed
     "use" statement.
   - Fixed a bug in Pod::Parser::_interpolate_bottom_up that made it stop
     interpolating interior sequences after the first line of a paragraph.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.05
 - Fixed a bug in Pod::Usage (it was using an obsolete name to access an
   attribute instead of using the new access method).
 - Removed the use of $`, $&, and $' throughout all modules in this package.
 
 Version 1.04
 22-Dec-1997           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.04
 + SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
   * Created a Pod/InputObjects.pm and moved the details of input streams
     and interior sequences into appropriately named objects defined
     in this file.
   * Pod::PlainText now handles =for and =begin/=end
   * Added the curr_headings() method to Pod::Select
   * Fixed a few very simple but very stupid errors with improper version
     numbers in the .pm files.
   * Pod::PlainText now inherits from Pod::Select (instead of Pod::Parser)
     because it needs to use the curr_headings() method.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.03 (major revision)
 + SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
   * If a POD directive begins with '==' instead of '=', then that line
     is considered a paragraph by itself (you dont need a blank line
     before you begin the next paragraph). NOTE that this only works
     for the *beginning* of a paragraph!! If the '==' begins a line
     in the *middle* of a paragraph, then it receives no special treatment
     and is not considered to be the beginning of a new POD directive.
     If this added convenience seems confusing at first, just remember the
     following phrases:
        "LESS IS MORE" -- LESS equals signs need MORE newlines!
        "MORE IS LESS" -- MORE equals signs need LESS newlines!
     As long as you dont forget that the '=' on a POD directive always
     comes *before* the newline that ends the paragraph (so the '=' is
     associated with the first word of each phrase) you should be fine.

   * The '=pod' command *IS* *NOW* *PASSED* TO Pod::Parser::command()!

   * ALL INSTANCE DATA FIELDS HAVE BEEN RENAMED! Rather than using the new
     field names, you should use the newly provided field access methods to
     get/set private instance data. These are as follows:

         Accessor Method           Old Field Name
       -------------------      -------------------
         cutting()                   CUTTING
         output_file()               OUTFILE
         output_handle()             OUTPUT
         input_file()                INFILE
         input_handle()              INPUT
         total_lines()               LINE
         total_paragraphs()          PARAGRAPH
         input_streams()             INPUT_STACK
         top_stream()                INPUT_TOP
         sequence_commands()         SEQUENCES

   * The last parameter passed to the command() and interior_sequence()
     methods has changed. Please see the documentation!

   * The stack of interior sequences being processed is NO LONGER an
     array of text-strings. It is now an array of hash-refs!

   * Renamed my version of Pod::Text to Pod::PlainText to avoid some nasty
     problems it caused for CPAN.

   * The method Pod::Parser::interpolate() NO LONGER MODIFIES its first
     argument (which means the argument doesnt have to be an l-value)!
     This method is now a wrapper which invokes the new method named
     _interpolate_bottom_up(). This new method *is* recursive and *does*
     modify its first argument.

   * _interpolate_bottom_up() contains a small but ugly *hack* to allow
     '->' and '=>' to remain untouched inside of C<...> (without having
     to use the E<gt> escape sequence) PROVIDED THAT there is something
     to the left of it OTHER THAN another '-' or '='.

   * The 'select()' and 'want_section()' methods have moved from Pod::Parser
     into Pod::Select.

   * All callback and callback-related methods have moved into the new
     module Pod:::Callbacks (which is NOT YET FINISHED for this release).

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.02
 - Added the ability to register callbacks for =xxxx paragraphs and other
   paragraphs. This means that one could (for example) register a temporary
   callback after =item is seen to handle the very next paragraph and then
   unregister itself. The methods added were add_callbacks and rm_callbacks.
   Also, a private method invoke_callbacks was added to go about the business
   of invoking callbacks. The callback mechanism Ive implemented is extremely
   flexible and also way more complex than Id like (and hence requires lots
   more documentation than I would like). Also, the interfaces to add_callbacks
   and rm_callbacks tries to be very flexible in the number and type of
   arguments you can give it. This is probably too flexible to the point
   of being too difficult to figure out how to use. My callback mechanism
   is very powerful but I think the interface to it is lousy and far too
   complex. I am desperately in search of a way to make it smaller and
   simpler without removing too much functionality. If you have any ideas
   about how to do this PLEASE SHARE THEM WITH ME!

 - Got rid of =pod pragmas. P5P has decided to use =for, and =begin/=end
   instead and Ill just handle those like regular commands. NOTE THAT THIS
   MEANS THE command() METHOD SHOULD NOW EXPECT TO BE PASSED =pod COMMANDS.

 - Expanded the documentation for Pod::Usage to be (hopefully) a little less
   confusing regarding the various different invocation styles. Many thanks
   to Steven McDougall <swmcd@world.std.com> for spending many hours of
   assistance toward this goal.

 - Fixed Pod::Text to use the proper indentation for nested '=item' lists
   and to handle consecutive =item paragraphs. (Thank you to Diab Jerious
   <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu> for helping me with this one.)

 - Fixed a bug in Pod::Parser that was causing the argument to =over to be
   a newline instead of the empty string when no "over count" was given.

 05-Sep-1996           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.01
 - Commented out "use diagnostics" in all modules
 - Made use of "use vars"
 - Added the instance variables $self->{INPUT_STACK} and $self->{INPUT_TOP}
   to Pod::Parser and made it possible to use the parse_from_file() and
   parse_from_filehandle methods() to process "included" files (in addition
   to normal pods that dont "include" other files).
 - Added MSG option/key to pod2usage().

 19-Aug-1996           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Version 1.00 (first "official" release):
  - Renamed Pod::Filter to Pod::Parser at Kenneth Albanowski's recommendation.
  - Moved podselect() into its own separate module Pod::Select to avoid
    unnecessary namespace pollution in Pod::Parser.
  - Renamed several methods and added another preprocessing method in
    Parser.pm.
  - Pod::Parser now keeps track of the current line and paragraph number
    and the current input and output file names.
  - Fixed parse_from_filehandle() to recognize a line matching /^\s+$/ as a
    paragraph terminator.
  - Included Pod::Usage and Pod::Text as part of the PodParser distribution
    rather then packing and releasing each module separately.
  - Removed pod2text.PL and added pod2usage.PL


 07-Aug-1996           Brad Appleton                   <bradapp@enteract.com>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Initial release of version 0.01 to garner some feedback. This release was
 actually three separate "initial" releases of Pod::Parser, Pod::Text, and
 Pod::Usage which were originally named Pod::Filter, Pod::PlainText, and
 Pod::Usage (respectively).
