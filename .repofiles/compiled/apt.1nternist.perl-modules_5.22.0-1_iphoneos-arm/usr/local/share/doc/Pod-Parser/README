 WHAT IS THIS?
 =============
 This software distribution contains the following packages for using
 Perl5 "pod" (Plain Old Documentation).  See the "perlpod" and "perlsyn"
 manual pages from your Perl5 distribution for more information about pod.

 Pod::Parser
 -----------
   The Perl5 module "Pod::Parser", which provides a base class for
   parsing and selecting sections of POD documentation from an input
   stream.  Please see the POD documentation for this module (embedded
   in the file "Parser.pm") for more details.

 Pod::Select
 -----------
   The Perl5 module "Pod::Select", which provides a subclass of
   Pod::Parser and an exported function named "podselect()" to dump
   selected sections of raw pod documentation from an input stream.
   Please see the POD documentation for this module (embedded in the
   file "Select.pm") and Pod::Parser for more details.

 Pod::Usage
 ----------
   The Perl5 module "Pod::Usage" which provides the function "pod2usage()"
   to print usage messages for a Perl script based on its embedded pod
   documentation. Pod::Usage is a subclass of Pod::PlainText. Please see
   the POD documentation for this module (embedded in the file "Usage.pm")
   for more details. The pod2usage() function is probably the most
   generally useful function in this entire distribution since it is
   useful to just about any Perl5 script that is invoked from the
   command-line.

 Pod::PlainText
 --------------
   A replacement for the Perl5 module "Pod::Text" and the corresponding
   "pod2text()" function. It is derived from the Pod::Parser class.
   Please see the POD documentation for this module and Pod::Parser for
   more details (embedded in the file "PlainText.pm").

   *NOTE*: As of perl 5.00_58, Pod::PlainText has been re-written by
   Russ Allbery, and has been renamed to Pod::Text in the core Perl
   distribution (replacing the previous implementation of Pod::Text).
   The Pod::PlainText module is still provided with Pod::Parser on CPAN
   solely for backward compatibility. Once Perl 5.6 becomes the latest
   stable version of Perl, then Pod::PlainText will be removed from the
   Pod-Parser distribution!!

 Pod::InputObjects
 -----------------
   Some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for advanced users of
   Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides its name and text.

 Pod::Checker
 ------------
   A module to check the syntax of a POD document. It is just in the
   very beginning stages right now and is *far* from being thorough or
   complete. Its just a starting point that I hope others who plan to
   use it can help me flesh it out further.
   This module also collects information about hyperlink nodes of the
   document processed that can be used by converters later on.

 Pod::ParseUtils
 ---------------
   A module with several object-oriented helpers for POD parsing and
   processing. Probably the most important is Pod::Hyperlink for
   parsing and expanding POD hyperlinks L<...>.

 * Kenneth Albanowski for his extensive assistance with the design and
   interface of Pod::Parser.

 * Steven McDougall for his help and patience with re-writing the manpage
   for Pod::Usage and Pod::Parser.

 * Achim Bonnet for helping me get the regression test-suite into a form
   that works with 'make test' generated by MakeMaker

   make pre-release versions of Pod::Parser work with code and giving me
   feedback on the implementation and design.
