Lighttpd Sbsettings Toggle, PHP, Ifile or ssh,libid3tag, install all of those from cydia then put phppod in var/www/ then set permissions to 777 and then but the bin folder in bin looks like this /bin/bin set that to 775 after that reboot then open a web browsner and type localhost there you go :)


Requirements
------------

iPhone / iPod Touch :)
Jailbroken
OpenSSH installed and corresponding client (e.g. WinSCP)
Lighttpd & PHP both installed and working correctly


Installation
------------

If you're reading this, you've un-zipped the iphpPod package already...

In WinSCP (or whichever client you're using), on the iPod 'side', 
go to /Library/Webserver/Documents/

If you have a previous version of iphpPod installed, 
please delete the iphpPod directory in /Library/Webserver/Documents/

Copy over the entire iphpPod directory (as extracted from the zip file) 
into /Library/Webserver/Documents/

Change the permissions on the iphpPod directory which is now 
in /Library/Webserver/Documents/ to 0777 (rwxrwxrwx)

If you already have a 'default' media download directory, 
e.g. /private/var/root/Media/Downloads or /private/var/mobile/Downloads, 
set the permissions on this directory to 0777 also.

If you have the Safari Download Plugin installed, please disable it
prior to launching iphpPod.

On your iPod Touch, launch MobileSafari and enter the address
http://127.0.0.1/iphpPod/index.php


Settings
--------

Media directory:

  The first time you load iphpPod, it will search the following paths
  in the below order:

  /private/var/mobile/Media/Downloads
  /private/var/mobile/Downloads
  /private/var/root/Media/Downloads
  /private/var/root/Downloads

  If none of these are found, you will need to create one via SSH.

  In order to create video thumbnails, this directory also needs
  0777 permissions.

  This option will also scan sub-directories within your media folder
  and any directories within them (and so on...).

  Please ensure you have no symbolic links which point back to your
  media directory or any of its sub-directories as this will cause
  an infinite loop and the script to time-out.

Put the Bin folder in bin and permission set to 777 in 
place files in /bin
should look like /bin/bin/
