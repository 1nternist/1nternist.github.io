=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_link> [S<I<debhelper options>>] [B<-A>] [B<-X>I<item>] [S<I<source destination> ...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_link> is a debhelper program that creates symlinks in package build
directories.

B<dh_link> accepts a list of pairs of source and destination files. The source
files are the already existing files that will be symlinked from. The
destination files are the symlinks that will be created. There B<must> be
an equal number of source and destination files specified.

Be sure you B<do> specify the full filename to both the source and
destination files (unlike you would do if you were using something like
L<ln(1)>).

B<dh_link> will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy - absolute
when policy says they should be absolute, and relative links with as short
a path as possible. It will also create any subdirectories it needs to to put
the symlinks in.

Any pre-existing destination files will be replaced with symlinks.

B<dh_link> also scans the package build tree for existing symlinks which do not
conform to Debian policy, and corrects them (v4 or later).

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item debian/I<package>.links

Lists pairs of source and destination files to be symlinked. Each pair
should be put on its own line, with the source and destination separated by
whitespace.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-A>, B<--all>

Create any links specified by command line parameters in ALL packages
acted on, not just the first.

=item B<-X>I<item>, B<--exclude=>I<item>

Exclude symlinks that contain I<item> anywhere in their filename from
being corrected to comply with Debian policy.

=item I<source destination> ...

Create a file named I<destination> as a link to a file named I<source>. Do
this in the package build directory of the first package acted on.
(Or in all packages if B<-A> is specified.)

=head1 EXAMPLES

 dh_link usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

Make F<bar.1> be a symlink to F<foo.1>

 dh_link var/lib/foo usr/lib/foo \
   usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

Make F</usr/lib/foo/> be a link to F</var/lib/foo/>, and F<bar.1> be a symlink to
the F<foo.1>
