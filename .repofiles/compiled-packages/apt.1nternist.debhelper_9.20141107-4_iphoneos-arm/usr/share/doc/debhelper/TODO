This is the TODO for debhelper. As more and more people use debhelper, this
list grows - I welcome patches to fix items on it!

Wishlist items:

* All debhelper programs should only accept the options they are documented
  to accept (rather than accepting all debhelper options). They should
  be able to print brief usage summaries.

  I think this calls for a restructuring. Make a Debhelper.pm class. Each
  program subclasses the class. The class provides command line parsing,
  useful functions, and so on. Skeleton of a debhelper command would then
  be:

  use base qw{Debhelper};

  sub startup {
  	# Add initialization stuff here.
  }

  sub perpackage {
  	my $package=shift;

  	# Stuff to do for each package here.
  }

  sub fini {
  	# And final stuff here, if any.
  }

  This needs more thought.
  
v8:

* escaping in config files (for whitespace)?
* make dh_install use hard links for efficiency
* dh_installinit --restart-after-upgrade as default?
* #487006: dh_installman with 3-letter codes

Deprecated:

* DH_COMPAT 1, 2, 3. Can be removed once all packages are seen to be using
  a newer version. I won't hold my breath. Now with evil warning messages
  though.
* Also, grep the entire archive for all dh_* command lines,
  and check to see what other switches are not being used, and maybe remove
  some of them. I'd also like to deprecate/remove debian/compress files, -X is
  a better idea.
* dh_suidregister. Once nothing in the archive uses it.
* dh_installmanpages.
* dh_testversion. Remove as soon as nothing uses it.
* dh_movefiles. I won't hold my breath.
* debconf-mergetemplates support and the debian/template.ll files and the
  debconf-utils dependency.
* dh_undocumented
* dh_installinit --init-script
* dh_python
* dh_clean -k (make it warn)
